###Spatial aggregation. [4 Marks]
-Which state (consider all stations in that state) has the highest average PM2.5 concentration across all stations and across all years?
-Which state (consider all stations in that state) had the most days with hazardous PM2.5 levels (above 300 µg/m³) for the year 2023?
-Which state has the highest variability in PM2.5 levels across its monitoring stations in 2023? (Think how would you measure variability)
-Which state has the lowest average PM2.5 levels during the Covid period (The year 2020-2021 both years inclusive)?

###Temporal Aggregation [3 Marks]
-Report the station that recorded the highest value of PM 2.5 for the month Aug of 2020.
-For the year 2018, calculate the average PM2.5 concentration for each season (Seasons being Winter: December-February, Summer: March-May, and Monsoon: June-September) for stations Lal Bahadur Shastri Nagar, Kalaburagi - KSPCB. Identifying the season with the highest pollution.
[Thought Question] Can you suggest some potential factors on why certain seasons are generally more polluted than others?
-Compare the average PM2.5 levels during weekends and weekdays for the station Lal Bahadur Shastri Nagar, Kalaburagi - KSPCB over the year 2021. Create a plot to show these trends Steps:
--Calculate the monthly average PM2.5 for weekdays and weekends separately
--X-axis: Months (January to December).
--Y-axis: Average PM2.5 levels.
--Use two lines: one for the monthly average PM2.5 levels on weekdays and one for weekends.

###Spatio-temporal aggregation [3 marks]
-For each state, calculate the percentage increase or decrease in PM2.5 levels during monsoon months (June to September) compared to summer months (March to May). Which state has the most difference (increase or decrease) for the year 2022?
-Plot the average PM2.5 levels for Delhi across each season (Winter: December-February, Summer: March-May, Monsoon: June-September) from 2017 to 2023. What seasonal variation, if any, can you observe in pollution levels?
-Plot a time-series graph comparing Delhi’s PM2.5 levels with Mumbai’s from 2015 to 2023. Which city had more fluctuations? (Hint: Think what fluctuation means)

###Population-Based [3 Marks]
-Which state in India has the highest number of monitoring stations relative to its population? 
-Plot a bar chart showing the top 5 most polluted states in terms of per capita PM2.5 exposure in 2023.
-Plot the relationship between population density and average PM2.5 concentration for each state. What conclusion can you draw about the correlation between population density and pollution?
--X-axis: Population density (people per square kilometer).
--Y-axis: Average PM2.5 concentration.
--Use a scatter plot to show the relationship, where each point represents a state.

###Area Based [3 Marks]
-Which state has the highest PM2.5 concentration per square kilometer? Plot the pollution levels for all states relative to their area.
--X-axis: States.
--Y-axis: PM2.5 concentration per square kilometer.
--Use a bar plot where each bar represents a state, and the height shows PM2.5 per sq km.
-Compare the total number of monitoring stations per square kilometer in each state. Identify the state with the highest density of monitoring stations relative to its area. Show a bar plot where each bar represents a state, and the height shows the number of monitoring stations per square kilometer.
-Compare the average PM2.5 levels between Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh over the year 2021. Given that both states have similar area sizes but different population densities, analyze how population density impacts pollution levels in these two states.

###Funding Based [3 Marks]
-Compare the average PM2.5 levels between states that received NCAP funding and those that did not in 2021.
-Create a time series plot showing PM2.5 levels with an increment in NCAP funding for Assam. Has an increment of the financing led to noticeable improvements in air quality?
-Create a scatter plot to showcase the area versus funding received by a state. Mark every state with a different color and show the legend outside the plot.

###Miscellaneous Questions [5 Marks]
-For the most polluted city in 2023 (highest average pollution in 2023), calculate the percentage of days with PM2.5 levels above the hazardous threshold (300 µg/m³)[1 Mark]
-Analyze the PM2.5 levels in Delhi during Diwali (October-November) and New Year compared to regular months over the 3 years (2018-2020). Do you observe any significant pollution spikes during these festivals? If spikes are observed, Can you mark these spikes using arrows?[1.5 Mark]
-Identify the state that received the highest NCAP funding in 2020 and determine if its air pollution levels improved significantly by 2023. Use a line graph to compare yearly average PM2.5 trends.[1 Mark]
-Draw the map of India and plot the sensor locations on the map.[1.5 Mark]

###Tell us something new [1 Mark]
-Tell us something interesting from the dataset that we have not asked. Anything that intrigues you, anything that might be useful to the policymakers.
